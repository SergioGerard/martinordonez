## Abstract of Sayed Abbas Arshadi’s PhD Thesis

**Title**: *Three-Phase DC-DC Resonant Converters for High-Power Battery Charging Applications*

**Abstract**:  
Battery chargers are the power processing stage between energy sources and batteries. To meet modern technological requirements, higher efficiency, higher power density, and enhanced reliability are expected from these power converters.

This research aims to increase the efficiency of power converters in high-power Electric Vehicle (EV) battery charging applications. Compact size, high efficiency, and high reliability are critical requirements for these chargers. The work focuses on adopting **three-phase DC-DC resonant configurations** for battery charging converters.

A thorough analysis of **three-phase LLC resonant converters** was conducted to understand the converter's current-sharing behavior. A **current-sharing technique** was proposed to improve performance. Additionally, a **new modulation technique** was introduced to support wide voltage regulation required for battery charging applications. This technique also enhances converter efficiency during **light-load operations** (e.g., when the batteries are nearly fully charged).

In another part of the study, **three-phase CLLC resonant converters** were analyzed for **bi-directional battery charging applications**. The proposed current-sharing technique was tested, and its effectiveness was verified.
