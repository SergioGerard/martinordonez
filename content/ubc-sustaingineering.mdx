# UBC Sustaingineering Team: A Story of Success

We are very proud of the tremendous progress made by **UBC Sustaingineering Team**. Its story of success has been recently published at *UBC Life Blog*. 

The team, originally founded by **Martin Ordonez**, has this year an outstanding workforce with more than 50 students from different disciplines and is led by **Abdul Moiz**, **Sajan Rajdev**, and **Jorge May**, one of the graduates at Martin Ordonez Lab.

## Passionate Individuals Driving Sustainable Change

UBC is full of passionate individuals trying to make the world a better place. **Sustaingineering** is a club where such individuals work to achieve sustainable solutions for the problems in our world. 

The team was founded by **Dr. Martin** as a source of motivation for encouraging students to empower change. 

## Achievements and Partnerships

While Sustaingineering is still a young club, they have already made remarkable progress. In partnership with **ENICALSA**, they developed a remote monitoring system for solar water pumps located in remote communities in Nicaragua.

Since its foundation, Sustaingineering has been sponsored by the **Fred Kaiser Foundation for Higher Education** and the **Faculty of Applied Science** at UBC.
