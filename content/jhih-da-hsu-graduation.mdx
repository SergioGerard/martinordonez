## PhD Thesis Abstract

### Title:  
**‚ÄúHigh-Performance Resonant Converters for Battery Chargers: Efficiency and Dynamics Improvement‚Äù**

### Abstract:

As the demand for clean energy grows, the need for high-performance power conversion in energy storage and battery charging applications is increasing. Resonant converters, especially **LLC or CLLC** types, have become widely used for high-power battery chargers.

This thesis focuses on improving the performance of resonant converters in two key areas: **efficiency** and **dynamics**.

1. **Efficiency Improvement**:  
   The work addresses the reduction of conduction losses in output rectifiers through **Synchronous Rectification (SR)**.  
   Traditional SR controllers rely on the **drain-source voltage** (vds.on) as a control input, but this approach is susceptible to noise, leading to mis-triggering and reduced efficiency.  
   The proposed SR strategies introduce:
   - **Resonant Capacitor Voltage (RCV)-based SR driving**.
   - A **simplified SR method** based on the **Volt-Second Product (VSP)** of the SR drain-source blocking voltage and rectifier current conduction time.  
   These approaches improve efficiency by reducing sensitivity to parasitic noise.

2. **Dynamic Performance Enhancement**:  
   This research also introduces a new **small-signal modeling methodology** based on **Extended Describing Functions (EDF)** and phasor analysis. This model accurately predicts the frequency response across both low- and high-frequency regions, enabling **high-bandwidth designs**.  
   The enhanced small-signal model, combined with the proposed SR strategies, achieves improved efficiency and dynamic performance.

This work provides practical insights for designing high-performance resonant battery chargers, contributing both to **efficiency improvements** and **dynamic stability**.
