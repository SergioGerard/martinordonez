## Abstract: Mohammad Ali Saketâ€™s PhD Thesis

**Title:**  
*"High-Efficiency and Low Noise Planar Transformers for Power Converters: Paired Layers Interleaving"*

### Abstract  
Magnetic components of any switching power supply are usually the bulkiest part of the circuit and determine the overall height of the converter. The design and/or selection of magnetics can affect the selection and cost of all the other associated power components, besides determining the overall performance, size, and form factor of the converter itself.  

Nowadays, many applications, such as **consumer electronics, the automotive industry, and telecoms**, require high power density and low-profile power converters. However, the height of traditional magnetic cores often causes the form factor of power converters to be plump and bulky, making them unsuitable for such applications.  

To implement slim-profile converters, the **Planar Transformer (PT)** has emerged, featuring low height, simple reproducibility, lower leakage inductance, and low thermal resistance. Despite these benefits, PTs are known for their **large parasitic capacitance** due to the significant overlap and proximity of planar layers, degrading power converter performance.  

Capacitive effects in transformers are divided into two types:  
1. **Inter-winding capacitance**: Generates **Common-Mode (CM) noise**, causing **EMI problems**.  
2. **Intra-winding capacitance**: Affects **converter efficiency** and **voltage regulation** in LLC resonant converters.  

Reducing inter-winding capacitance by separating primary and secondary windings can increase leakage inductance and AC resistance. Conversely, interleaved structures minimize AC resistance and leakage inductance but significantly increase inter-winding capacitance. This results in a **design trade-off** between minimizing parasitic elements.  

This dissertation presents **new design methods** to address these challenges by focusing on the root cause of parasitic capacitance. A **detailed parasitic capacitance model** is developed to connect the distributed capacitance of layers with the transformerâ€™s equivalent circuit.  

The **Paired Layers Interleaving** concept introduced in this thesis provides criteria to achieve **zero CM noise generation** in PTs. Using this method, overlapping layers of primary and secondary windings are designed so that no CM noise is generated. These **"paired layers"** allow for highly interleaved structures with low AC resistance and leakage inductance while maintaining minimal CM noise.  

The model is applicable to various power converters, divided into three categories. Multiple examples demonstrate the methodâ€™s generality across different winding types, turn ratios, and topologies. The proposed method is validated through **analysis, Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations, and experiments**.  

Additionally, this dissertation investigates the negative effects of PTâ€™s large **intra-winding capacitance** on **LLC resonant converter voltage regulation** under light load conditions. It shows that intra-winding capacitance distorts the transformerâ€™s voltage, resulting in loss of regulation.  

To address this issue, **six new winding layouts** with minimal intra-winding capacitance are presented. These layouts ensure proper voltage regulation even under no-load conditions and enable the design of wide-range planar inductors with **high self-resonant frequency**, ideal for high-frequency operation.
