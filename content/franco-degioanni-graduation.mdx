## Abstract: Fast Dynamic Transient Solutions for Three-Phase PWM Converters  

The ever-growing global energy demand accentuates the importance of integrating renewable energy sources into the grid. Beyond fulfilling escalating energy needs, this integration holds the potential to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. In this context, power electronics systems assume a key role in the efficient utilization of renewable energy. Particularly, the three-phase pulse-width-modulated (PWM) converter serves as the bridge that facilitates the seamless interaction between the grid, distributed resources, and loads.  

However, as power electronics systems increase in complexity, challenges emerge in terms of modeling, control design, and implementation. Overcoming these challenges necessitates advancements in control design to enhance dynamic performance and optimize the efficiency of integrating renewable energy.

This thesis aims to improve the understanding of the dynamic characteristics of three-phase PWM converters and develop novel tools for modeling, analyzing, and improving their dynamic performance in grid-connected applications. By employing concepts such as normalization, state plane representation, and geometric analysis, a comprehensive large-signal model for three-phase converters is developed.  

This model offers an intuitive graphical interpretation of the system’s dynamic behavior by illustrating its evolution in the state plane. Initially, the application of this framework facilitates the identification and characterization of the theoretical limits of dynamic performance. Consequently, it serves as a point of reference for control design engineers to conduct an objective assessment of the converter’s dynamic performance.  

Furthermore, the introduced analysis enables the development of high-performance control methods, even for challenging scenarios such as controlling active loads and bidirectional operation with wide operating range requirements. These control techniques ensure consistent large-signal behavior, fast transient responses, and low implementation requirements.  

In this manner, the thesis contributes to advancing power electronics modeling and control through the enhancement of the dynamic performance of three-phase converters.
