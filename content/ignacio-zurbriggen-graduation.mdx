## Abstract for Ignacio Galiano Zurbriggen‚Äôs PhD Thesis  

**Title**:  
*‚ÄúLarge-signal Transient Control in Power Electronics: an Average-Geometric Framework‚Äù*  

### Abstract  
Switch-mode power converters are a fundamental component of modern power systems. They are ubiquitous in renewable energy applications, electric vehicles, battery chargers, and power supplies. Controllers are essential in power converters to improve dynamic behavior during transients and in steady-state operation.  

For decades, the power electronics industry has preferred controllers based on small-signal analysis due to their low implementation requirements, despite limitations in dynamic performance and global stability. Non-linear boundary controllers based on state-plane analysis offer excellent dynamic response and global stability but come with higher implementation requirements.  

This thesis focuses on improving the dynamic performance of power converters by incorporating state-plane concepts while maintaining low implementation requirements to facilitate large-scale adoption.  

By combining traditional averaging modeling tools with state-plane analysis, the unified **Average Natural Trajectories (ANTs)** are obtained to accurately model the large-signal dynamic behavior of fundamental topologies (buck, boost, and buck-boost).  

The proposed framework lays the foundation for several dynamic performance improvement efforts introduced in this thesis. Using ANTs as a large-signal model, the theoretical limits of dynamic performance are defined, providing a powerful benchmarking tool for design engineers. Furthermore, a unified controller based on the ANTs model is developed for the fundamental topologies, offering predictable large-signal response and outstanding dynamic performance with low implementation requirements.  

The ANTs modeling approach is extended to **photovoltaic applications**, developing an extremely fast maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method for scenarios with rapidly changing environmental conditions.  

Finally, the concept of **dual-loop geometric control** is introduced, combining state-plane analysis with an industry-standard dual-loop control structure, bridging the gap between industrial applications and state-plane controllers.  

The concepts introduced in this thesis are supported by thorough mathematical analysis and validated by extensive simulation and experimental results. This thesis significantly contributes to the advancement of the field of modeling and control for power electronics.
