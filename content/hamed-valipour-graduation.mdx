## Abstract for Hamed Valipour‚Äôs PhD Thesis  

**Title:**  
‚ÄúHigh Efficiency Single-Phase Power Factor Correctors: Resonant Circuit and Flexible Topology‚Äù

### Abstract:  
Rectifiers with Alternating Current (AC) input and Direct Current (DC) output are required in many applications to regulate the output and provide a **Power Factor Correction (PFC)** capability. There are different applications for PFC rectifiers: wide-range and narrow-range.  

The purpose of this work is to propose two approaches to improve efficiency while keeping the performance high in both wide and narrow-range rectifiers.  

Wide-range applications require PFC converters to support extended variations in input voltage. A **PFC converter** capable of coping with a **wide input voltage range (90V<sub>RMS</sub> ‚Äì 530V<sub>RMS</sub>)** would significantly decrease costs and streamline development. In this work, a **reconfigurable PFC converter** is proposed which provides a **high and flat efficiency curve** throughout the entire operating voltage range. This converter has:  

- **Flexible bridgeless structure** with simple control  
- **Low current ripples** and **low common-mode noise**  
- **Startup inrush current handling capabilities**  

Narrow-range applications are also studied, where variations in input voltage are minimal. An advanced **LLCC resonant structure** is proposed, improving efficiency in these cases.  

The proposed design:  
- Operates first in a **DC/DC environment** and later modified for **AC input with a bridgeless configuration**  
- Enables **soft switching** for semiconductors without adding extra elements, using passive components in the design as a resonant tank  
- Provides **continuous input current** with small inductances, ensuring an **inherent PFC capability** with single-loop control  

These converters offer simple, symmetrical structure and easy control. The proposed solutions are analyzed both theoretically and experimentally, and their performance is compared to conventional structures, showing efficiency improvements and better performance.
