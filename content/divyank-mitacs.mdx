# Advancing Electric Vehicle Battery Charging Systems  

Coordinated by **Daniel Hsu**, Divyank’s work contributed to key research conducted in our lab by **German Nahuel Bogado** and **Gabriel Ferreira da Silva**, pushing the frontiers of electric vehicle (EV) battery charging systems. Divyank worked on the development of advanced tools enabling the accurate modeling of critical components in the system.

### From MITACS Impact Stories:  

> **"Timing is everything.** In cleantech innovation, it’s the difference between leading and falling behind. For **Professor Martin Ordonez’s** team at the **UBC Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering**, working in power electronics and conversion, one way of staying ahead is developing clean energy through research in renewable electric vehicles (EV) and power storage.  

> **'We work on power conversion.** It’s a timely, much-needed area of work. EV is a logical application for renewable storage. We’re part of an ecosystem. Companies needing talent are moving into this field. We want to ensure we can capture that talent,' says Ordonez.  

Governments and industries share this vision, committing **over $10 million** to this research area. Through this project, **vehicles and buildings** will become active participants in **city-scale energy transactions**.  

Professor Ordonez leads a talented team engaged in diverse battery research. For **Divyank Singh**, a senior undergraduate Engineering student from **India’s Manipal Institute of Technology**, visiting Canada this summer as a **Mitacs Globalink Research Intern (GRI)**, the opportunity to work in Ordonez’s lab is a **dream come true**.  

> **“I reached out to Dr. Ordonez** even before I knew about Mitacs’s GRI program. I’m researching **front-end EV battery power conversion** at the power outlet and charger connection. A major challenge is estimating the right size of battery for parkades,” says Divyank.  

He also supports other students working on power conversion by developing a **testing platform** using equipment available in Ordonez’s lab. His **automation platform** measures raw values, proving invaluable for both his project and the **modeling and simulation of larger batteries**.  

> **“With a major scarcity of fossil fuel** and clear global sustainability goals, we need to develop efficient, non-polluting solutions,” says Divyank.  

While his work focuses on **charging in a parkade**, it also informs the development of **batteries scalable for community-level energy delivery**.  

> **"I’m developing a platform for testing modeling** that will aid size estimation, bringing us one step closer to solving this challenge.”
